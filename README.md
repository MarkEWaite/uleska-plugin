# Uleska for Jenkins

**Note: Currently under development**

This plugin allows for easy integration with the 
[Uleska DevSecOps Platform](https://uleska.com), which automates and 
orchestrates software security testing within your DevOps pipeline.

The initial functionality is simply to kick of scans, therefore keeping your
vulnerability information up-to-date, but we plan to build on this in future
releases.
